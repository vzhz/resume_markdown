<h1>Veronica Hanus</h1> 
Veronica has been working on the edge of software engineering for years. Her background is in the earth sciences, where her experience has included geochemistry, paleomagnetism, and landing-site selection for the [Mars Curiosity Rover](http://www.space.com/18027-mars-rover-curiosity-amazing-photos-red-planet.html). She looks forward to being able to create software that helps inform solutions, and leverages her background and interest in people. She welcomes opportunities that can help her stitch together the technical skills she has pursued to embark on a career in web development. She enjoys solving problems, talking about what she's learning, and has been told she's on the better side of the [Dunning-Kruger scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

*Current*
---
In my day-to-day, I am balancing several projects and trying to keep my checkbook balanced at the same time. I've built [a personal website](https://vzhz.github.io/) and as I've learned more about programming, I've tried to impliment each improvement on that site, which has meant less duplicated code, better file structure, improved alt text, a (confusingly non-working) RSS feed, and validated HTML and CSS. I'm currently in the process of templating my (currently very redundent) static blog with [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). <br/>

I'm also making a webpage with a form that returns text about what I'm doing in my life (kind of like an automated holiday card) as a first web project and a stepping stone to projects that other people will enjoy even more than an update from me. So far, I have the form built and have been struggling through the "how does the web work" part of starting a web project. I am just starting to have the courage to explore the devloper tools in the browser and I know I have a long way to go before I am confident using them. <br/>

When I take breaks from learning to program, I'm dreaming of [my next outdoor adventure](https://vzhz.github.io/blog/2015/07/10/seven-days-on-a-bike.html), [crafting things](https://vzhz.github.io/blog/2016/11/29/new-charger.html), doing spur-of-the-moment adventures like [hauling my (new!) mattress across Manahattan](https://github.com/vzhz/resume_markdown/blob/master/mattress.jpg), and walking dogs for some combination of love and money. <br/>


<!--Even though I like pair programming and working with other folks, I'm usually pushing forward with myself and my google skills.<br/>-->
<!--I find breaking projects into parts and identifying what I need to learn to do each one challenging (and exciting!). People who I talk to about programming regularly comment that my approach to learning is to dip my toe into many skills and change directions often. -->
