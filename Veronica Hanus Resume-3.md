<h1>Veronica Hanus</h1> 
Veronica has been working on the edge of software engineering for years. Her background is in the earth sciences, where she has experience in both academic and industry research, and looks forward to being able to create software similar to what she's used in her research, which has included geochemistry, paleomagnetism, and landing-site selection for the [Mars Curiosity Rover](http://www.space.com/18027-mars-rover-curiosity-amazing-photos-red-planet.html). She welcomes opportunities that can help her stitch together the technical skills she has pursued to embark on a career in web development. She enjoys solving problems, talking about what she's learning, and has been told she's on the better side of the [Dunning-Kruger scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).
